# Iris_Dataset_Example
This project demonstrates classification using the Iris dataset with machine learning algorithms. The main focus is on implementing a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning that contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three classes (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

The goal of this project is to showcase how classification models can be trained, evaluated, and visualized. The code is implemented in two styles: a regular procedural version and an object-oriented (OOP) version for better modularity and reusability.

# Implementation
Dataset: Iris Dataset - 150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes

Model: Decision Tree Classifier

Evaluation: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

# Requirments 
This project requires tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn. It was developed using a Python environment through VSCode.

Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the following dependencies:

```
matplotlib==3.10.6
pandas==2.3.3
scikit-learn==1.7.2
scipy==1.16.2
seaborn==0.13.2
```
# How to Use
To utilize this code, a Python environment should be installed onto the computer with the [requirements](#requirements) fulfilled. Download the Iris_Decision_Tree.py file onto your computer into a folder. Then open that folder/file on VS Code. 

Another way to open this file is to clone the repository within Github. To do this, you press the Code button on Github and copy the HTTPS URL. When you open VS Code, you will be prompted to make a selection. One of the options is to clone a repository, and if that is pressed, you can paste the URL. This will open the repository into Github. 

# Error Handling 
This project does not have any error handling.
